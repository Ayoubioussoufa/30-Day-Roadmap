Below is an 8-week, 6-days/week roadmap. Each day ≈2–4 focused hours.
---

# The Outcome You’re Aiming For

* **Language mastery**: understand JS execution, memory, types, async, iteration, modules, and meta-programming at a spec-level intuition.
* **Runtime fluency**: comfortable in **browser** and **Node** (and can translate between them).
* **Ecosystem literacy**: can learn any library in hours using a repeatable method.
* **Engineering maturity**: profile, test, secure, and document your work like a pro.

# The “Learn Any Library in 90–180 Minutes” Method

1. **Map the mental model** (15 min): What problem does it abstract? Dataflow? Pull/push? Declarative/imperative?
2. **Skim API surface** (15 min): Core primitives, lifecycle, config objects, return types, typed generics.
3. **Run the quickstart** (20 min): Small hello-world; note where config or context comes from.
4. **Minimum viable features** (30–60 min): Implement 2–3 canonical tasks (e.g., list → details → mutation; or subscribe → update → teardown).
5. **Read the source of one core file** (20 min): Find invariants and error paths.
6. **Make and publish a small example** (30 min): Gist/repo with README explaining tradeoffs.
7. **Create a cheat sheet** (10 min): Common patterns, foot-guns, and gotchas.

**Practice libraries (lightweight picks):**

* UI/State: Zustand or Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query
* Data/Validation: Zod, date-fns
* Viz/3D: D3 or Three.js
* Networking: Axios vs native fetch wrappers
* Node: Fastify, Playwright (for e2e), Vitest/Jest
* Build: Vite, Rollup

# Mastery Checkpoints (what “expert” looks like)

* **Language**: Explain `this`, closures, and the event loop with correct ordering, and predict tricky outcomes without running code.
* **Async**: Implement cancellable workflows with `AbortController`, backpressure via streams, and concurrency control.
* **Tooling**: Publish an ESM+CJS lib with types, CI, and semver releases.
* **Performance**: Use DevTools to isolate a bottleneck and cut it down meaningfully.
* **Security**: Prevent XSS/CSRF in the browser and SSRF in Node; set a sane CSP.
* **Testing**: Maintain a green CI with flake detection and ≥80% meaningful coverage.

# What You’ll Produce (portfolio)

* 4–6 **micro-libraries** (utilities, iterables, promise tools).
* 1 **CLI** on npm with docs.
* 1 **PWA** with offline support and IndexedDB.
* 1 **Capstone** showing architecture, performance, tests, and security.
